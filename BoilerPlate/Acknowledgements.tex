\begin{abstract}
  This thesis is the culmination of a few dozen people pushing a single person to the finish line. Here I name a few of my fellow backers. Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Veronique Boisvert for her support and guidance during tough times. To my fellow PhD students: Dan Hayden, Neil Cooper-Smith, Liam Duguid, Robert Cantrill, Matthew Rose, and Tim Brooks, thank you for sharing your wisdom and more importantly for making the office a wonderful place to work. To the other members of the ATLAS group and the JAI who have at one time or another given me advice, thank you for making me feel like part of the team.
  A massive thank you must go to my brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews for all of their support and personal guidance during trying times, and their positive and loud nature during happy times.
  Para mis padres, Ana y Mario Blanco, no hay palabras para describir la magnitud del apoyo que me habeis dado. No hubiera podido hacer nada sin ustedes. Desde el fondo de mi corazon, los quiero mucho. Sin duda tengo los mejores padres que un hijo puede pedir.
  Last but not least, I want to thank my wonderful partner Ashton ``Boo Face'' Turnbull for your relentless belief in me, even when I did not believe in myself. Not a single page of this thesis would have existed if it wasn't for you. Thank you, I love you.
  To everybody, I am finally done.
