\begin{abstract}
  As it turns out, a doctoral thesis is the culmination of a few dozen people supporting and guiding a single person to the finish line. Here I name a few of my fellow backers. Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Veronique Boisvert for her support and guidance during tought times. To my fellow PhD students, Dr. Dan Hayden, Dr. Neil Cooper-Smith, Dr. Liam Duguid, Dr. Rob and Dr. Tim Brooks for their ROOT, C++ knowledge and most of all for making the office a wonderful place to be. To the other members of the ATLAS group who have at one time or another given me sage advice over the years and for your interest in me and my work, thank you for making me feel like a part of the team.
  A massive thank you must go to my brothers, sisters-in-law and nephews for all of their help, support and personal guidance during tough, emotional times and their positive, loud nature during happy times. Para mis padres, no hay palabras para describir la magnitud del apoyo que me habeis dado. No hubiera podido hacer nada sin ustedes, desde el fondo the mi corazon, los quiero mucho. Sin duda tengo los mejores padres que un hijo pudiera pedir. Last but not least, I want to thank my wonderful partner Ashton ``booface'' Turnbull for believing in me event when I did not believe in myself. Not a single page of this thesis could exist without you. Thank you.
