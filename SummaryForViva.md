## Page 20 ##

### Quantum Electrodynamics ###

 * Mediated by photon
 * Strength characterized by the fine structure constant α
 * Couples to charge so charged leptons couple to photon
 * No self coupling of photons 
 * Fundamental vertex (gamma -> ff)
 * Example interactions (e+e- -> e+e-)

## Page 22 ##

### Quantum Chromodynamics ###

 * Mediated by gluons
 * Strong force introduces colour, colour and anticolour
 * Both quarks and gluons have colour
 * Gluons self-interact:
     - Three and four gluon vertex
 * Quarks scatter off gluons
     - Flavour does not change but colour does
     - Difference carried by gluon
     - Gluon have a colour state and anticolour state

## Page 23 ##

### Quantum Chromodynamics ###

 * There are eight coloured gluons and one colourless
 * Asymptotic freedom:
     - Gluon self-interaction results in screening
     - Interaction with quarks results in opposite effect
     - Overall screening wins out
     - Potential decreases with distance and quarks form boundless states
 * Hadrons:
     - Baryons and Mesons

## Page 24 ##

### Weak interactions ###

* Responsible for nuclear interactions
* Mediated by W+- and Z0 boson
* Range is small due to massive bosons
* Fermions interactions:
    - Simple
* Boson self-interaction
* Quark interactions more complex
    - Neutral currents cannot change quark flavour (up into down and vice-versa)
    - Charged currents do change quark flavour
* Semileptonic decay of b quarks, b to c transition

## Page 54 ##

### Calorimetry ###

 * Divided into two sections, EM and hadronic
 * Sampling calorimetry, active and passive material
     - Passive material causes particles to radiate and active material measures energy of radiation shower
 * Energy loss depends on the type of particle
     - Electrons losses energy via Bremsstrahlung, while photons via pair production
     - Characteristic length associated with energy loss for electrons is the radiation length X0
     - For photons the number of photon decreases exponentially by a factor of 7/9X0
 * The number of shower particles changes as a function of the interaction length
 * Hadronic showers are 1/3 EM
 * Energy measured proportional to actual energy of incident particle
 * Type and thickness of material is varied to improve energy measurement and reduce punch-through into the muon system.
     - Radiation hardness important
 * Coverage of calorimetry

     - Based on five track parameters and calo information
 * MUID algorithm

## Page 70-72 ##

### Jet reconstruction ###
 * Jets are recombined products of gluons and quark hadronization
 * Closest physical representation of the original 4vector of q or g
 * Theoretical and experimental requirements on reco algorithms:
     - Infra-red and collinear safety: Jets should not be affected by soft emissions or collinear splitting
     - Work with parton, hadron, or calorimeter information
     - Stable under increased luminosity or CMS, computationally efficiently and fast, and work independently of detector technology

### Anti-kT algorithm ###
 * Group together objects iteratively based on momentum and angular position
 * Soft objects tend to merge with hard objects
 * Jets tend to be conical if two hard objects are sufficiently separated they will form conical jets
