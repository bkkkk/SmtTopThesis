\chapter{Muon identification criteria} \label{app:DetectorMuonID}

Muon identification criteria are defined for MUID are presented below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Tight}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Passes MUID Combined selection \OR
    \item MUID Standalone at $|\eta|>2.5$ \AND\ has atleast three MDT+CSC stations \OR
    \item MuGirl with extended track \AND\ (at least two MDT+CSC stations \OR\ less than six MDT+CSC holes on track)
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Medium}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tight \OR
    \item MuGirl with extended track \OR\ $|\eta|<0.2$ \OR\ has at least two muon track segments \OR
    \item MuTagIMO at $|\eta|<0.2$ \OR\ has at least two muon track segments
  \end{itemize} 
  \item \textbf{Loose}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Medium \OR
    \item MuGirl \OR
    \item MuTagIMO \OR
    \item MuidStandalone
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
