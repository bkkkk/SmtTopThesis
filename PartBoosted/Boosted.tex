\chapter{The Soft Muon Tagger in a boosted $t\bar{t}$ environment} \label{sec:boosted_study}
A presentation and discussion of the results of the feasibility study conducted
to determine the viability of using the Match-$\chi^{2}$ to tag signal muons from top-quark decays.
Additionally a short performance study is carried to
\section{Examination of the topology of a boosted event}
\section{Estimation of the SMT selection efficiency}
