\chapter{$t\bar{t}$ cross-section measurement in the $\ell$+jets channel using SMT} \label{prt:cross_section}

\textit{This section describes a \ttbar\ cross-section measurement carried out the joint RHUL-QMUL SMT group. }

Measurement of the \ttbar\ production cross-section is important for two reasons. First, the value of the \ttbar\ cross-section is a powerful test of the SM and perturbative QCD. Additionally, \ttbar\ events constitute a background to other analyses such as SUSY searches and Higgs boson searches and properties studies. Presented here is a measurement of the top-pair production cross-section at \cmsS\ in the lepton plus jets channel, with at least one of the $b$-quarks in the event decaying semileptonically producing a soft muon.

\section{Object selection and event selection} \label{sec:CrossSectionEventSelection}
The selection criteria used in this analysis are based on the nominal \cmsS\ selections constructed by the ATLAS top group. Some alterations have been implemented to adapt to the usage of the \xsm-tagger instead of the standard MV1 method for $b$-jet tagging.

\section{Background estimation} \label{sec:CrossSectionBacgkround}

Semi-leptonic \ttbar\ events have a varied final state signature that includes a lepton, multiple jets including $b$-jets and missing energy. As a result \ttbar\ analyses must take into account many different types of background including diboson, \W+jets, \Z+jets, single-top and multijet. Data-driven methods are used for the dominant multijet and \W+jets backgrounds while MC is used to estimate the smaller \Z+jets, diboson and single-top.

\subsection{Multijet in the electron channel}
The multijet background is a difficult background to reduce and estimate. Measurement of multijet events depends very strongly on detector conditions, which in turn depend on external factors which cannot be simulated. Multijet events that pass the event selection include non-isolated or misidentified electrons from photon conversion or charged hadrons. As a result, data-driven methods must be employed when estimating the amount of multijet background. This analysis makes use of two different methodologies, The so-called matrix method is used for the central value of the estimate and the ABCD method for verification and use as a systematic.

At pretag level the multijet content in the signal region is estimated by using the matrix method. In addition to the standard electron selection a looser selection is defined. Events are categorized by whether they pass the loose or standard selection. The number of events in each category is the sum of events with ``real'' electrons and ``fake'' electrons as follows:
%
\begin{align}
  N^{\textrm{loose}} &= N_{\textrm{real}}^{\textrm{loose}} + N_{\textrm{fake}}^{\textrm{loose}} \\
  %
  N^{\textrm{std}} &= rN_{\textrm{real}}^{\textrm{loose}} + fN_{\textrm{fake}}^{\textrm{loose}}
\end{align}
%
where $r$ and $f$ are the ``real'' and ``fake'' efficiencies for the loose event to also pass the standard selection. Given a measured $N^{\textrm{std}}$ and $N^{\textrm{loose}}$ and if $f$ and $r$ are known the number of events with a fake electron that passes the standard selection can be calculated as
%
\begin{equation}
  N_{\textrm{fake}}^{\textrm{std}} = fN_{\textrm{fake}}^{\textrm{loose}} = f\frac{N^{\textrm{std}}-r N^{\textrm{loose}} }{(f-r)}
\end{equation}

The relative efficiency $r$ is measured from an inclusive sample of $Z\rightarrow ee$ events and $f$ is measured from a sample of events with exactly one loose electron, at least one jet with a \pt$>25\GeV$ and \met$<20\GeV$. An uncertainty of $50\%$ is assigned to the pretag estimate to cover the respective uncertainties on $f$ and $r$.

To derive the tagged estimate the pretag estimates are scaled by the probability of SMT tagging an event. The tagging probability of multijet events $R_{\textrm{SMT}}^{\textrm{multijet}}$ is derived from control regions defined by the isolation of the electron and the \met\ cut that forms part of the event selection, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CrossSectionABCDRegions}.

  \caption{A diagram of the \met-isolation phase space. Shown are the four regions as defined by the event selection.}
  \label{fig:CrossSectionABCDRegions}
\end{figure}

These four regions can be identified as a background-dominated region, containing events with low-\met\ and a non-isolated electron; a signal region, with events that pass the event selection; and two control regions, containing events with high-\met\ or an isolated electron. The events in each of the regions then represents a different type of phenomenon. The tagging rate is simply defined as
%
\begin{equation}
  R_{\textrm{SMT}} = \frac{N_{Tagged}}{N_{Pretag}} 
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the number of events in the region. Contributions from other processes such as $W$+jets, $Z$+jets, \ttbar, single-top and diboson events are subtracted using MC simulation. The contribution from \ttbar\ is initially based on the theoretical cross-section, an estimate for the multijet contribution is determined using this cross-section and a new measured cross-section is obtained. The measured cross-section is used to rescale the \ttbar\ contribution and a new cross-section is obtained. This process is repeated until the measured cross-section stablizes, which in this case occurred after two iterations. 

The uncertainty on the tagging-rate contains statistical and a systematic contributions. The systematic uncertainty includes the uncertainty on the cross-section of the \ttbar\ and $W$+jets samples, uncertainty arising from the SMT tagger and finally uncertainties arising from the BR re-weighting described a priori.

The final tagging-rate is the unweighted average of all the regions. The uncertainty is the difference between regions A and C, as this is larger than any regional uncertainty. The tagging-rate and subsequently the tagged multijet background estimate is measured on a per-jet bin basis. The tagging-rates per region for each jet-bin are shown in Table~\ref{tab:rsmt}.

\subsubsection{The ABCD method}
The ABCD method relies on a pair of uncorrelated variables to extrapolate the amount of multijet events from a set of control regions into the signal region. First a two-dimensional phase-space is constructed, in this case the same two variables, missing energy and isolation are used. If these two variables are uncorrelated then the following relation holds
%
\begin{equation}
  N^{\textrm{multijet}}_{\textrm{D}} = \frac{N^{\textrm{multijet}}_{\textrm{B}} * N^{\textrm{multijet}}_{\textrm{C}}}{N^{\textrm{multijet}}_\textrm{A}}
\end{equation} 
%
where $N^{\textrm{multijet}}_{X}$ is the number of multijet events in region $\textrm{X}$.

This allows for an estimation of the number of multijet events that pass the event selection by extrapolating from the background region into the signal region. Contributions of other processes such as $W/Z$+jets, single-top, diboson and \ttbar\ to regions A,B and C are removed using MC data. Thus, the number of events in each region is measured as
%
\begin{equation}
  N^{\textrm{multijet}} = N^{\textrm{data}} - N^{W+\textrm{jets}} - N^{Z+\textrm{jets}} - N^{\textrm{diboson}} - N^{\ttbar} - N^{\textrm{single-top}}
\end{equation}

\section{Results and conclusion} \label{sec:results_and_conclusion}

The final cross-section is determined by a cut-and-count method. Finally the cross-section is calcuated as

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{\ttbar} = \frac{N_{\textrm{data}} - N_{\textrm{bkg}}}{\int L \textrm{ d}t \times \epsilon \times \textrm{BR(noFullHad)}}
\end{equation}
