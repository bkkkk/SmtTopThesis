We present our major architectural design choices and outline the arguments that led to these choices.

It uses the parton-shower approach for initial- and final-state {QCD} radiation, including colour coherence effects and azimuthal correlations both within and between jets. This article updates the description of {HERWIG} published in 1992, emphasising the new features incorporated since then. These include, in particular, the matching of first-order matrix elements with parton showers, a more correct treatment of heavy quark decays, and a wide range of new processes, including many predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, with the option of R-parity violation. At the same time we offer a brief review of the physics underlying {HERWIG} together with details of the input and control parameters and the output data, to provide a self-contained guide for prospective users of the program. This version of the manual (version 3) is updated to {HERWIG} version 6.5, which is expected to be the last major release of Fortran {HERWIG.} Future developments will be implemented in a new C++ event generator, {HERWIG++.}},

The stress is on the phenomenological approach and basic theoretical concepts rather than rigorous mathematical detail. Short descriptions are given of some of the key experiments in the field, and how they have influenced our thinking. Although most of the material is presented in the context of the Standard Model of quarks and leptons, the shortcomings of this model and new physics beyond its compass (such as supersymmetry, neutrino mass and oscillations, {GUTs} and superstrings) are also discussed.

The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a role, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various {QCD-based} models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data.
