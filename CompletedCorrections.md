# Completed Corrections
**By Jacobo Ezequiel Blanco [ID: 100536604]**

This is a list of all the corrections that were suggested and my responses to them. This includes all corrections in the original printed list provided by Dr. Hays, any comments found in the bound copy provided by Prof. Khan, and any noted comments made during the viva.

Two page numbers are associated with each correction. The first is the one related to the pre-viva version of the thesis, and the second associated with the post-viva corrected version. Note that some corrections may have moved up or down a page due to some minor last minute changes in the thesis.

If a typographical error was found (e.g. "semil**pe**tonic") or a simple improvement suggestion was made (e.g. enlarge diagram), the correction was carried out and no further response is included. Where comments were addressed in a different manner than suggested or where no suggestion was made, the changes carried out are detailed below the original comment and labelled **Response**.

## General 

If a correction was suggested that should apply to the whole thesis, it is included here. These items are not repeated under each relevant section in this document, but are applied on the entirety of the thesis.

 * **Correct**: Pagination
 * **Correct**: Don't split J/psi in line break
 * **Correct**: Separate the description of the detector and reconstruction into two chapters
 * **Correct**: The use of "statistics" when referring to amount of data
 * **Correct**: Remove STACO CB from everywhere or define
     - **Response**: Acronym defined in reconstruction part
 * **Correct**: Don't split $W$ boson across line-break

## Abstract

 * **Correct**: Do not prepare "soft muon tagging" for capitalization
 * **Correct**: "Muons [*from*] J/psi decays"
 * **Correct**: "...acceptance to [*the*] $W$ muon"
 * **Correct**: "...method on muons [*from*] J/psi"

## Preface

 * **Correct**: "Standard Model of [*p*]article physics"

## Introduction

 * **Correct**: Page 15 >> Page 19 - "confirmed the production of [*the*] Higgs boson..." 
 * **Change**: Page 16 >> Page 20 - "This boson ~~would~~ *could* decay.."
 * **Add**: Citations for ATLAS experiments, the Higgs, the SM, and BSM theories
 * **Add**: Citation to "confirmed the production of the Higgs boson..."
